Small, possibly over-engineered project for my friend group to submit out of context quotes. Will be polishing it along the way.

### Build
`setup.sh` prompts the webpage's password, instantiates the project and sets up the database tables. I haven't actually tested this script yetâ€”if it doesn't work you should run the Julia code line by line in the REPL.

### Run
After that you can start the server with `bin/server`. Pay attention to what Genie environment you're in (`dev` or `prod`).
